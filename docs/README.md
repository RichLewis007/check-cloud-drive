# Documentation

This directory contains the static HTML files for the GitHub Pages site.

The main page is `index.html`, which provides documentation and information about the Check Cloud Drives application.

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

## Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain configured at the GitHub account level, GitHub Pages will automatically use it. Make sure your domain's DNS is properly configured according to GitHub's documentation.
